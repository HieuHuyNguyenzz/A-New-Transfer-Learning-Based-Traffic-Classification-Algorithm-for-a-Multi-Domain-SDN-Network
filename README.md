# A New Transfer Learning Based Traffic Classification Algorithm for a-Multi Domain SDN Network
This is the source code and experiment results in the paper ['A New Transfer Learning-Based Traffic Classification Algorithm for a Multi-Domain SDN Network'](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3628797.3628804), published in the SOICT 2023 conference.

However, this is not the code that we used in the original paper. This is the code and results that were created in the Researchs of HUCE students, which included one original author of the paper (which is me :D), in order to re-run the experimetals.

This research is conducted along with Hải, Duy, Đạt, Phúc.
